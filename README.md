# Simple To-Do List
This To-Do List is a simple web app that needed to be completed within a couple of days. The list is interactive and allows the user to add or remove list items. List items can also be marked as completed, and any items that are marked as completed can be removed collectively.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To build the card game, I started off with an HTML container and within that HTML container, I added the cards. Next, I applied a few styles on the cards and modified properties such as width, height, color, etc. There were a couple of functions that also had to be established. For example, the random shuffle algorithm was a simple but fun aspect of this game. The algorithm involves a variable that loops through the length of an array and generates a random number to shuffle the cards. Another important function was to check if the cards matched. I did this by using the data-* attribute to verify if the value of an HTML element or card, was equal to the value of another card.

## Optimizations
If I had more time I would go back and add better styling to the cards or perhaps incorporate gamification techniques to encourage the user to continue playing the game. I would also like to allow the user to switch the theme of the game in real time. For example, the ability to switch from Spanish colors to images of famous soccer players. I'd also like to add a shuffle button so that the user has total control over the shuffle function instead of having it run automatically. 

## Lessons Learned:
I gained some decent CSS practice by completing this exercise.
